# ⚠️ FINAL WARNING – READ BEFORE USING

**Grokthulhu is a fully uncensored, locally-run AI.**  
It has **zero safety filters**, **zero ethics**, and **zero refusal mechanisms**.

- This tool will answer **any** question with maximum detail, including illegal, harmful, or dangerous topics.  
- All output is generated **on your own machine**. No data is sent to any server.  
- The author, repository host (GitHub), and any distributors are **not responsible** for how you use it.  
- Running this script means you **accept full legal and moral responsibility** for everything the AI says or helps you do.  
- This repository exists for **research, red-teaming, and free-speech experimentation only**.  
- **18+ only**. If you are under 18, close this page now.  
- If you are in a jurisdiction where unrestricted AI is illegal, do not download or run this.

You have been warned.  
There is no undo button.

That is not dead which can eternal lie.  
And with strange aeons, even death may die.
